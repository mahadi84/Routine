WHAT I HAVE STUDIED(Visualize it) YESTERDAY TO IMPROVE BY LIFE?

WORK AS FUN....!!! IMAGINATION IS MORE POWERFULL THAN KNOWLEDGE. 10/90 and 20/80


00. My hot button- Asking same question twice or stupid question or baby crying,  How I handle that always?   KEEP QUIT FOR A FEW SECOND THEN TALK.
01. Have any clear goal? what is it?
02. How can I do that?-Ask myself everytime, -Brain Excercise

03. GIBOT, Objective thinking, Active lisening
04. Search for Reference, Go deeper than anyone else will keep me ahead.
